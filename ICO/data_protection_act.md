Pinciple 1: Fair and Lawful

This is the first data protection principle. In practice, it means that you must:

- have legitimate grounds for collecting and using the personal data;
- not use the data in ways that have unjustified adverse effects on the individuals concerned;
- be transparent about how you intend to use the data, and give individuals appropriate privacy notices when collecting their personal data;
- handle people’s personal data only in ways they would reasonably expect; and
- make sure you do not do anything unlawful with the data.

Is it possible to use or disclose personal data for a new purpose?

As you develop the goods and services you offer, you should think about whether your customers are likely to reasonably expect you to use their personal data to offer them these products. If you are unsure about this, you should explain your intentions and, at the very least, give your existing customers an easy way to opt out. If you intend to make a significant change, such as proposing to disclose customer information to others, you will usually need to get your customers’ consent.

What about “privacy notices”?

It is clear that the law gives organisations some discretion in how they provide fair processing information – ranging from actively communicating it to making it readily available.

Some of the most accessible notices for the public use phrasing such as “how we use your information”.

In general terms, a privacy notice should state:

- your identity and, if you are not based in the UK, the identity of your nominated UK representative;
- the purpose or purposes for which you intend to process the information; and
- any extra information you need to give individuals in the circumstances to enable you to process the information fairly.

Principle 2: Purposes

The Data Protection Act says that:

Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purposes, and shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or those purposes.

In practice, the second data protection principle means that you must:

- be clear from the outset about why you are collecting personal data and what you intend to do with it;
- comply with the Act’s fair processing requirements – including the duty to give privacy notices to individuals when collecting their personal data;
- comply with what the Act says about notifying the Information Commissioner; and
- ensure that if you wish to use or disclose the personal data for any purpose that is additional to or different from the originally specified purpose, the new use or disclosure is fair.

Principle 3: Adequacy

The Act says that:

Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which they are processed.

In practice, it means you should ensure that:

- you hold personal data about an individual that is sufficient for the purpose you are holding it for in relation to that individual; and
- you do not hold more information than you need for that purpose. (excessive)

Principle 4: Accuracy

The Act says that:

Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.

To comply with these provisions you should:

- take reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy of any personal data you obtain;
- ensure that the source of any personal data is clear;
- carefully consider any challenges to the accuracy of information; and
- consider whether it is necessary to update the information.

Principle 5: Retention

The Act does not set out any specific minimum or maximum periods for retaining personal data. Instead, it says that:

Personal data processed for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.

This is the fifth data protection principle. In practice, it means that you will need to:

- review the length of time you keep personal data;
- consider the purpose or purposes you hold the information for in deciding whether (and for how long) to retain it;
- securely delete information that is no longer needed for this purpose or these purposes; and
- update, archive or securely delete information if it goes out of date.

Principle 6: Rights

The Data Protection Act gives rights to individuals in respect of the personal data that organisations hold about them. The Act says that:

Personal data shall be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects under this Act.

This is the sixth data protection principle, and the rights of individuals that it refers to are:

- a right of access to a copy of the information comprised in their personal data;
- a right to object to processing that is likely to cause or is causing damage or distress;
- a right to prevent processing for direct marketing;
- a right to object to decisions being taken by automated means;
- a right in certain circumstances to have inaccurate personal data rectified, blocked, erased or destroyed; and
- a right to claim compensation for damages caused by a breach of the Act.

Subject Access Request

It is most often used by individuals who want to see a copy of the information an organisation holds about them. However, the right of access goes further than this, and an individual who makes a written request and pays a fee is entitled to be:

- told whether any personal data is being processed;
- given a description of the personal data, the reasons it is being processed, and whether it will be given to any other organisations or people;
- given a copy of the information comprising the data; and given details of the source of the data (where this is available).

Damage or Distress

An individual has a right to object to processing only if it causes unwarranted and substantial damage or distress. If it does, they have the right to require an organisation to stop (or not to begin) the processing in question.

So, in certain limited circumstances, you must comply with such a requirement. In other circumstances, you must only explain to the individual why you do not have to do so.

Preventing Direct Marketing

Individuals have the right to prevent their personal data being processed for direct marketing. An individual can, at any time, give you written notice to stop (or not begin) using their personal data for direct marketing. Any individual can exercise this right, and if you receive a notice you must comply within a reasonable period.

Automated Decision Making

The right of subject access allows an individual access to information about the reasoning behind any decisions taken by automated means. The Act complements this provision by including rights that relate to automated decision taking. Consequently:

- an individual can give written notice requiring you not to take any automated decisions using their personal data;
- even if they have not given notice, an individual should be informed when such a decision has been taken; and
- an individual can ask you to reconsider a decision taken by automated means.

These rights can be seen as safeguards against the risk that a potentially damaging decision is taken without human intervention. We explain below what is meant by automated decision taking and how the rights work in practice.

Correcting Inaccurate Personal Data

Where personal data is inaccurate, the individual concerned has a right to apply to the court for an order to rectify, block, erase or destroy the inaccurate information.

Compensation

If an individual suffers damage because you have breached the Act, they are entitled to claim compensation from you. This right can only be enforced through the courts. The Act allows you to defend a claim for compensation on the basis that you took all reasonable care in the circumstances to avoid the breach.

Principle 7: Security

The Data Protection Act says that:

Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data.

This is the seventh data protection principle. In practice, it means you must have appropriate security to prevent the personal data you hold being accidentally or deliberately compromised. In particular, you will need to:

- design and organise your security to fit the nature of the personal data you hold and the harm that may result from a security breach;
- be clear about who in your organisation is responsible for ensuring information security;
- make sure you have the right physical and technical security, backed up by robust policies and procedures and reliable, well-trained staff; and
- be ready to respond to any breach of security swiftly and effectively.

Principle 8: International

The Data Protection Act says that:

Personal data shall not be transferred to a country or territory outside the EEA unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data.

This is the eighth data protection principle, but other principles of the Act will also usually be relevant to sending personal data overseas. For example, the first principle (relating to fair and lawful processing) will in most cases require you to inform individuals about disclosures of their personal data to third parties overseas. The seventh principle (concerning information security) will also be relevant to how the information is sent and the necessity to have contracts in place when using sub-contractors abroad.

The Act also sets out the situations where the eighth principle does not apply, and these situations are also considered in more detail in this section.
